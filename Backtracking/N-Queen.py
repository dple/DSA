1. Naive recursive approach
    - Generate all possible permutations of [1, 2, 3, â€¦, n] using Use backtracking
    - For each permutation, check if any two queens are placed on the same diagonal.
    - If a permutation is valid during diagonal check, add it to our result.

Time complexity: O(N!N) - N! for checking all permutations and O(N) for checking if permutation is valid 
Space complexity: O(N)
